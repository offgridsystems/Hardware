# Pack Supervisor hardware for the 127x97m board
These are the printed circuit board (PCB) files, CAD files, specification sheets and all technical drawings needed to make the DKblock Pack Supervisor board. Note that the bill of materials (BOM) and other technical documents can be opened in OpenOffice format and PCB files are in EAGLE format.
Two versions are provided, Rev A and Rev B. Revision A is a fully tested board, put into limited production and used on a 72V electric scooter named Fido, and a 150V VW bug conversion. Revision B are design files that make improvements on the A version, but the board has neither been built nor tested in the real world.
All hardware is released as open source hardware (OSHW) under the definition by the OSHWA: https://www.oshwa.org/definition/
